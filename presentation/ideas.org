* pros-
  - type safety checking (lvl: awesome)
    + exacerbated even further for sum-types
  - really good performance & memory footprint amongst most languages
    that offer its feature-set
  - terse, almost as much as python/ruby

* cons-
  - build tools are...hard to decipher. Nothing as central as
    cabal/Hackage, for instance..
    + Attempts like Oasis(http://oasis.forge.ocamlcore.org/) seem to
      have stagnated
  - many ways to do most things (*possible* pro)
  - multi-core support-not very clear. Some projects provide decent
    support by using multiple processes. Global interpreter-lock.
    Direction seems to be message-passing?
